**Spring Cloud Config Server & GitHub Backend**

The Config Server is a centralized repository for configuration properties that can be accessed by applications throughout the system.
This makes it easy to manage configuration properties for all of your applications in one place, and it also makes it easy to change 
configuration properties without having to redeploy your applications.

**Configure the Spring Cloud Config Server:**
**Git:** The Config Server can be configured to store configuration properties in a Git repository. This is the most common way to configure the Config Server,
as it allows you to version your configuration properties and easily roll back to a previous version if necessary.
